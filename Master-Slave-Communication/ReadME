This project contains the use of communication protocols of ESP32 specifically ESP_NOW & BLE 

I have used the p10 led board as slave and a 2nd esp32 as master .
Master will send the string to slave and then slave will send command to led board to display.

We can later replace master with any mobile or lapop application for remote access.
