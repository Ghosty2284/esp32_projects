 Overview :

This project contains a basic test_jig consisting of a stepper motor which drives a belt through axle. Object is placed on the belt which can move roughly about  100cm.
Start position is 2.5cm right of home postition ( where stepper is attached). Start to end distance is 80cm.

COMPONENTS USED:

1. Nema 17 Stepper Motor 24V

2. TB6560 Motor driver updated

3. optical endstop photoelectric light control optical limit switch for 3D printer

Features :

1. 4 motion profiles : a. Acceleration - User define accelration and target velcoity for the object. 
                       b. Constant Velocity - User define constant velocity 
                       c. Trapezoidal mode - User define accelration & deceleration distance , cruise velocity , acceleration/deceleration ( note should obey v^2=2u+as) 
                       d. Distance mode - User defined distance 

2.  Safety switches - On both ends to avoid overshooting of the object 

3. E-Stop - Emergency stop command for object to hault motor immediately after command is sent. 

4. Home/Calibration - Object automatically finds home postion and then calibrates to start postion

5. Optical encoder - To count pulses and can be used as feedback.
