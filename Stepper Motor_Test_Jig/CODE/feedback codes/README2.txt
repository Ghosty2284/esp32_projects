===============================================


5] PID ----> Made a pid feedback based code which is working perfectly. Only PID tuning using  kp,ki,kd values need to be tuned to reduce oscillations of object and calibration.


6] merged_feedback_DATA : The code to display all parameters to build mathematical feedback equation which i spoke in readme i.e previous part.


7] FINAL feedback ---  Feedback code based on linear equation between steps and pulse

( needs to be verified )
